For safety reasons, it's probably best avoided when you can spot snow on top of the mountain or when there are thunderstorms in the area. Low-flying clouds of any variety, for that matter, can envelop you and muck up the views; it's not for nothing that Clouds Rest got its name."

This trail starts near Camp 4, along the Valley Loop Trail, and immediately begins its climb, switchback after switchback, through oak woodland. You will begin to climb above some trees and into exposed plateaus that offer you a glimpse of what's to come: great views of Yosemite Valley and its many iconic landforms. Do not stray off of the maintained path, as you will find steep drops adjacent to the trail."
